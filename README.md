# MOVIES-ETL1

## Overview of the Project

The purpose of the project is to create an automated pipeline for Amazing Prime that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. 
The starter codes provided has been refactored to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and to perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Results
The four technical analysis deliverables as per the requirement have been uploaded to this repository 
- Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
- Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
- Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
- Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
